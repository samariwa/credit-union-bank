Explanation of Each Test Case
=============================

test_get_account_list: Checks if we can retrieve a list of accounts.

test_get_account_detail: Verifies we can get details of a specific account by ID.

test_create_transaction: Ensures that transactions can be created successfully.

test_get_business_list: Validates retrieval of the list of businesses.

test_roundup_feature: Tests the RoundUp feature, checking the calculated savings.

test_spending_trends: Verifies that the spending trends feature works and returns data in the expected format.

test_update_business_sanction_status: Tests the ability to update a business's sanction status.

Notes
-----

Authentication: Each test case uses JWT token authentication for secure access to endpoints. The token is set in the setUp method and applied to each request using self.client.credentials.

Data Assertions: Each test verifies not just the HTTP status code but also checks specific data points to ensure the API is returning the correct information.

RoundUp and Spending Trends: Custom actions are tested to validate their business logic.

Summary
-------
By adding these unit tests, you ensure that your API endpoints work as expected and are resilient to future changes. These tests cover core CRUD operations, custom logic, and API authentication, providing a solid foundation for verifying the integrity of your Django REST API.
